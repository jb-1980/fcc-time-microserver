      <p>
	    This is just a simple api service to obtain a timestamp from a
	    date string and vice versa according to the challenge from
	    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice">Free Code Camp</a>

		I chose to use moment.js as a library to work with the dates
		because I liked the way that it could accept date strings as
		well as validate them. I suppose that datejs would be another
		option to explore. Of course, this could also be done with some
		vanilla javascript as the requirements of the challenge were not
		too difficult. But I liked that the library already accepts
		natural language strings. So in the spirit of DRY, moment worked
		for me.
